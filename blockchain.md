Choose a Blockchain Platform: Decide which blockchain platform you want to work with. Popular options include Ethereum, Hyperledger, and Cosmos.

Install blockchain-specific tools like Truffle for Ethereum development.

For Ethereum, learn Solidity, the programming language for writing smart contracts.

For Hyperledger, learn Chaincode, which can be written in Go, JavaScript, or Java.

Use tools like Web3.js or Ethers.js to interact with your deployed smart contracts from a web application.

Select a Blockchain Platform: Choose a blockchain platform to build your cryptocurrency. Popular options include Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and creating a custom blockchain using frameworks like Cosmos SDK or Substrate.

For a token on an existing blockchain, use standards like ERC-20 for Ethereum.

Implement features like transactions, mining, and wallet integration.

Blockchain software  Developer responsibility-

create the architecture of the system 

making smart contracts

optimize the protocols

create Dapps or decentralized applications

Responsible for the security of their blockchain network as well. 

Blockchain helps businesses to bridge the gap and ensure safety when it comes to data integrity.

How this helps us-

The Ledger- This offers immutability and distributed technology to the databases. No one can modify the DB.

Smart Contract -set of protocols  followed

Security- make transactions secure

skills needed-

Cryptography: 

to keep data safe. the study of protocols that prevent unwanted parties from accessing your data.  There's extensive use of cryptographic hash functions in the blockchain.

Smart Contracts- 

Smart contracts let two parties exchange goods or services without needing an intermediary.

compare smart contracts with a vending machine. You put in the payment, choose the product you want, get the product along with the remaining change. It basically removed third-party.

Development for Solidity (Ethereum blockchain) is used to make this type of contracts.

Data Structures-

it stores information in blocks rather than tables. The blocks are also cryptographically secured to ensure their integrity every time a block is added. so, it is important to have a solid knowledge of DS.

Blockchain Architecture- 

You should know what a ledger means in blockchain, what is consensus, and how smart contracts work. 

Languages You Must Know

Java, C++, Python, GO

Networking and distributed systems knowledge

Elixir (a high-performance functional language) use for making scalable distributed system.

Cryptonomics (economics of this industry)

cryptocurrencies don't have central banks to monitor the money supply or keep crypto companies in check, it's essential to understand the economic structures woven around them.

Various platforms where you can build a DApp (Decentralized applications)

Ethereum-

Ether is the cryptocurrency that fuels Ethereum.

It has its own language called Solidity, which is similar to C++ and JavaScript.

To create decentralized apps on the Ethereum blockchain.

Solidity: 

designed for developing smart contracts that run on Ethereum. solidity- is contract oriented language. As we know in object-oriented programming we talk about classes, objects. so in solidity, we talk about contracts and functions. like in class there are lots of methods like that in solidity contract there are lots of functions. solidity is a high-level language. you can consume those functions on Ethereum virtual machines.

Cosmos: 
The Internet of Blockchains
Cosmos is an ever-expanding ecosystem of interoperable and sovereign blockchain apps and services, built for a decentralized future. Cosmos is a project with an ambitious mission: To create a network of distributed ledgers that will solve long-standing problems in cryptocurrency. An ambitious project with the final goal of becoming the first decentralized exchange. 

Cosmos is a decentralized network enabling data exchanges between different blockchains

The Cosmos Hub is the blockchain protocol underlying an increasingly large number of blockchains built on the Cosmos Network, allowing them to communicate with each other. It functions much like how you use a computer to share files that can be opened on any operating system.

Cosmos’ native crypto is ATOM.

Other popular cryptos are- Bitcoin, Ethereum, Matic, Doge

The Cosmos Hub is being built by the Tendermint Core team.

Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC): 
designed by the Tendermint team to be an interoperable communication layer between different blockchain networks.

Tendermint’s significant technical capabilities allow developers to create their own blockchain platform without having to build everything from scratch. This is helpful because it allows users to create essentially any type of blockchain system they desire — with practically everything already completed for them, except for their application logic and token. Tokens that are hosted on the Cosmos Network include Kava (KAVA), Terra (LUNA), Band Protocol (BAND), Aragon (ANT), and Akash Network (AKASH). 

The Cosmos IBC protocol was built to solve one of the most important challenges blockchain systems face today: the lack of communication and data sharing between networks.

The Cosmos SDK is a modular framework designed to construct application-specific blockchains instead of virtual machine-based applications. 

The Cosmos SDK allows developers to use not only pre-built modules but also their own custom-built modules, enabling them to test their minimum viable product before launching their own public mainnet (blockchain protocols that have completed testing and are ready for public use)


The Cosmos SDK has also been used to construct a number of key blockchain and cryptocurrency projects, such as Binance DEX, Kava, Terra and IRISNet.

Developers can use the SDK to build innovative applications that create value through exchange with the Cosmos Hub.

What DEVELOPERS can build with this

Developers in Cosmos are the pioneers of the new era of blockchain technology. Join a fast-growing token economy and build upon a secure and stable foundation.

Decentralized Finance Applications

Create exchanges and marketplaces that allow anyone around the world to buy, trade, invest and lend – even without a bank account.

The default consensus engine available within the SDK is Tendermint Core (opens new window). Tendermint is the most (and only) mature BFT consensus engine in existence. It is widely used across the industry and is considered the gold standard consensus engine for building Proof-of-Stake systems.

with cosmos SDK you can build decentralised applications.

Hyperledger-

The Linux Foundation hosts Hyperledger as a hub for open industrial blockchain development.

Substrate is a modular framework that enables you to create purpose-built blockchains by composing custom or pre-built components.
