For the very first time in the history of the world, we have a way to generate and distribute money without a central power.

Cryptocurrencies are a new form of digital money that is maintained and secured by a community, instead of by governments or banks. Crypto could only be acquired through Mining or through ICO (Initial Coin Offering )

Solidity 

designed for developing smart contracts that run on Ethereum. solidity- is contract oriented language. As we know in object-oriented programming we talk about classes, objects. so in solidity, we talk about contracts and functions. like in class there are lots of methods like that in solidity contract there are lots of functions. solidity is a high-level language. you can consume those functions on Ethereum virtual machines.

Cosmos: The Internet of Blockchains

Cosmos is an ever-expanding ecosystem of interoperable and sovereign blockchain apps and services, built for a decentralized future. Cosmos is a project with an ambitious mission: To create a network of distributed ledgers that will solve long-standing problems in cryptocurrency. An ambitious project with the final goal of becoming the first decentralized exchange. 

Cosmos is a decentralized network enabling data exchanges between different blockchains

The Cosmos Hub is the blockchain protocol underlying an increasingly large number of blockchains built on the Cosmos Network, allowing them to communicate with each other. It functions much like how you use a computer to share files that can be opened on any operating system.

Cosmos’ native crypto is ATOM.

Other popular cryptos are- Bitcoin, Ethereum, Matic, Doge

The Cosmos Hub is being built by the Tendermint Core team.

Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC): designed by the Tendermint team to be an interoperable communication layer between different blockchain networks.

Tendermint’s significant technical capabilities allow developers to create their own blockchain platform without having to build everything from scratch. This is helpful because it allows users to create essentially any type of blockchain system they desire — with practically everything already completed for them, except for their application logic and token. Tokens that are hosted on the Cosmos Network include Kava (KAVA), Terra (LUNA), Band Protocol (BAND), Aragon (ANT), and Akash Network (AKASH). 

The Cosmos IBC protocol was built to solve one of the most important challenges blockchain systems face today: the lack of communication and data sharing between networks.

The Cosmos SDK is a modular framework designed to construct application-specific blockchains instead of virtual machine-based applications. 

The Cosmos SDK allows developers to use not only pre-built modules but also their own custom-built modules, enabling them to test their minimum viable product before launching their own public mainnet (blockchain protocols that have completed testing and are ready for public use)

Mainnet is the term used to describe when a blockchain protocol is fully developed and deployed, meaning that cryptocurrency transactions are being broadcasted, verified, and recorded on a distributed ledger technology (blockchain).

The Cosmos SDK has also been used to construct a number of key blockchain and cryptocurrency projects, such as Binance DEX, Kava, Terra and IRISNet.

Developers can use the SDK to build innovative applications that create value through exchange with the Cosmos Hub.

What DEVELOPERS can build with this

Developers in Cosmos are the pioneers of the new era of blockchain technology. Join a fast-growing token economy and build upon a secure and stable foundation.

Decentralized Finance Applications

Create exchanges and marketplaces that allow anyone around the world to buy, trade, invest and lend – even without a bank account.

The default consensus engine available within the SDK is Tendermint Core (opens new window). Tendermint is the most (and only) mature BFT consensus engine in existence. It is widely used across the industry and is considered the gold standard consensus engine for building Proof-of-Stake systems.

with cosmos SDK you can build decentralised applications.

What is cryptocurrency

various platforms for crypto mining

how to do the mining of currency? 

cryptocurrency is the most valuable digital asset. It has big values in the name of coins. It is all online.

According to Wikipedia

A cryptocurrency or crypto is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of the computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins.

It is a good investment. But it is illegal in some countries. It is a kind of virtual currency. In this, you have to store keys. These keys are also called tokens. The popular cryptocurrencies are bitcoin, Ethereum. There are 5000+ currencies available in the market now.

With this money, you can do transactions means you can send or receive money who are using this.

Now various social media platforms give the user the ability to generate the coins as much as they can according to the work they do on their platform. There are lots of platforms created using these technologies from which you can earn cryptocurrency and later you can redeem it with the dollar. 

These new social media platforms are offering an innovative solution to the problem: Give users the power to self-moderate. This blockchain technology is very robust. It can be combined with other technologies.

A blockchain is a particular type of irreversible distributed ledger that combines computation and data storage. Each new block that is added contains modifications to the state of the ledger that has been agreed upon by the consensus of the distributed nodes which run the network.

These platforms come under the category of Decentralized social networks.

They run on independent servers not on the centralized server that is owned by the business.

Popular Decentralized social networks(media) are Mastodon, Steem etc. which runs on social blockchain. As we know Social media promotes connectivity, community building, and knowledge sharing

A decentralized social network allows users more control. here your data is more secure. 

On these platforms, users can post anything without worrying about having their post taken down.

Nowadays more and more startups are emerging offering decentralized social platforms—often using blockchain technology. There are various currencies available in the market that work by using blockchain. On these platforms, you can do crypto mining.

Blockchain software  Developer responsibility-

create the architecture of the system 

making smart contracts

optimize the protocols

create Dapps or decentralized applications

Responsible for the security of their blockchain network as well. 

Blockchain helps businesses to bridge the gap and ensure safety when it comes to data integrity.

How this helps us-

The Ledger- This offers immutability and distributed technology to the databases. No one can modify the DB.

Smart Contract -set of protocols  followed

Security- make transactions secure

skills needed-

Cryptography: 

to keep data safe. the study of protocols that prevent unwanted parties from accessing your data.  There's extensive use of cryptographic hash functions in the blockchain.

Smart Contracts- 

Smart contracts let two parties exchange goods or services without needing an intermediary.

compare smart contracts with a vending machine. You put in the payment, choose the product you want, get the product along with the remaining change. It basically removed third-party.

Development for Solidity (Ethereum blockchain) is used to make this type of contracts.

Data Structures-

it stores information in blocks rather than tables. The blocks are also cryptographically secured to ensure their integrity every time a block is added. so, it is important to have a solid knowledge of DS.

Blockchain Architecture- 

You should know what a ledger means in blockchain, what is consensus, and how smart contracts work. 

Languages You Must Know

Java, C++, Python, GO

Networking and distributed systems knowledge

Elixir (a high-performance functional language) use for making scalable distributed system.

Cryptonomics (economics of this industry)

cryptocurrencies don't have central banks to monitor the money supply or keep crypto companies in check, it's essential to understand the economic structures woven around them.

Various platforms where you can build a DApp (Decentralized applications)

Ethereum-

Ether is the cryptocurrency that fuels Ethereum.

It has its own language called Solidity, which is similar to C++ and JavaScript.

To create decentralized apps on the Ethereum blockchain.

You can use blockchain technology for land deals. 

Soon Maharashtra will adopt blockchain and quantum computing.

Quantum computing 

Quantum computing includes calculations based on the probability of an object's state before it is measured - instead of just 1s or 0s - which means they have the potential to process exponentially more data compared to classical computers

Quantum Computing could change entire industries in the future like Healthcare, Finance, Telecommunications, Cybersecurity.

Quantum Computing comes in! Universal Quantum Computers use the unit qubits (quantum bits) instead of bits (0, 1)
