Cryptocurrency:
For the very first time in the history of the world, we have a way to generate and distribute money without a central power.

Cryptocurrencies are a new form of digital money that is maintained and secured by a community, instead of by governments or banks. Crypto could only be acquired through Mining or through ICO (Initial Coin Offering )

Mainnet is the term used to describe when a blockchain protocol is fully developed and deployed, meaning that cryptocurrency transactions are being broadcasted, verified, and recorded on a distributed ledger technology (blockchain). Deploy to Mainnet: Once your new crypto testing is complete, deploy your cryptocurrency to the main network.

how to do the mining of currency? 

cryptocurrency is the most valuable digital asset. It has big values in the name of coins. It is all online.

According to Wikipedia

A cryptocurrency or crypto is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of the computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins.

It is a good investment. But it is illegal in some countries. It is a kind of virtual currency. In this, you have to store keys. These keys are also called tokens. The popular cryptocurrencies are bitcoin, Ethereum. There are 5000+ currencies available in the market now.

With this money, you can do transactions means you can send or receive money who are using this.

Now various social media platforms give the user the ability to generate the coins as much as they can according to the work they do on their platform. There are lots of platforms created using these technologies from which you can earn cryptocurrency and later you can redeem it with the dollar. 

These new social media platforms are offering an innovative solution to the problem: Give users the power to self-moderate. This blockchain technology is very robust. It can be combined with other technologies.

A blockchain is a particular type of irreversible distributed ledger that combines computation and data storage. Each new block that is added contains modifications to the state of the ledger that has been agreed upon by the consensus of the distributed nodes which run the network.

These platforms come under the category of Decentralized social networks.

They run on independent servers not on the centralized server that is owned by the business.

Popular Decentralized social networks(media) are Mastodon, Steem etc. which runs on social blockchain. As we know Social media promotes connectivity, community building, and knowledge sharing

A decentralized social network allows users more control. here your data is more secure. 

On these platforms, users can post anything without worrying about having their post taken down.

Nowadays more and more startups are emerging offering decentralized social platforms—often using blockchain technology. There are various currencies available in the market that work by using blockchain. On these platforms, you can do crypto mining.

Sapien 

Sapien is a social news network built on the Ethereum blockchain that already has thousands of active users. The platform features a global reputation system, a reward system for users, and a marketplace for creators. Sapien is building Social Media that's Humans First. 

As social media users, we find ourselves at the bottom of a very powerful hierarchy ruled by corporations that don’t have our best interests at heart. This command-and-control structure means that the affordances engineered into the platform are driven by financial and business goals rather than enhancing our online social experience.

Sapien offers an alternative that recognizes our humanity and that is crafted to reward us, respect us, and nurture us so that we build more lasting and meaningful socio-digital relationships that elevate us to flourish, thrive, and evolve.

NEO-

it's focused on providing platforms for future digital businesses.

Consider NEO if you have applications that will need to process lots of transactions per second. 

EOS-

EOS blockchain aims to be a decentralized operating system that can support industrial-scale applications. It's basically like Ethereum, but with faster transaction speeds and more scalable.

You can use blockchain technology for land deals. 

Soon Maharashtra will adopt blockchain and quantum computing.

Quantum computing 

Quantum computing includes calculations based on the probability of an object's state before it is measured - instead of just 1s or 0s - which means they have the potential to process exponentially more data compared to classical computers

Quantum Computing could change entire industries in the future like Healthcare, Finance, Telecommunications, Cybersecurity.

Quantum Computing comes in! Universal Quantum Computers use the unit qubits (quantum bits) instead of bits (0, 1)

Quantum Machine Learning is the Future of AI. With AI we can also manage city traffic.

We can combine AI, blockchain & Machine Learning.
